Event-Driven Architecture for Agentic AI: Comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Executive Summary
This document outlines the design and requirements for AgentMesh EDA - a comprehensive Event-Driven Architecture framework specifically designed for Agentic AI systems. The platform provides unified abstractions for multiple messaging systems (Kafka, Pub/Sub, SNS/SQS, NATS, Pulsar) while enabling intelligent agent coordination through real-time event processing, dynamic routing, and autonomous decision-making capabilities.[1][2][3]
Product Vision
Mission: Create a unified, cloud-native event-driven platform that enables seamless coordination of AI agents across heterogeneous messaging infrastructures while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability, security, and scalability.
Vision: Become the de facto standard for building scalable, resilient agentic AI systems that can adapt and evolve in real-time across multi-cloud and hybrid environments.
Core Architecture Design
System Overview
The AgentMesh EDA platform consists of five core layers:
1. Message Abstraction Layer (MAL)
•Universal Message Interface: Standardized event schema supporting JSON, Avro, Protobuf, and CloudEvents formats
•Multi-Protocol Support: Unified API abstracting Kafka, Google Pub/Sub, AWS SNS/SQS, NATS, Apache Pulsar[4][5]
•Dynamic Routing Engine: Intelligent message routing based on content, agent capabilities, and system load
•Schema Registry: Centralized schema management with evolution and compatibility checking
2. Agent Orchestration Layer (AOL)
•Agent Registry: Service discovery and capability registration for AI agents
•Workflow Engine: Support for orchestrator-worker, hierarchical, blackboard, and market-based patterns[3]
•Dynamic Agent Lifecycle Management: Automatic scaling, health monitoring, and failover
•Context Management: Distributed state management and agent memory coordination
3. Event Processing Engine (EPE)
•Stream Processing: Real-time event correlation and complex event processing
•Event Sourcing: Complete audit trail with state reconstruction capabilities[6][7]
•CQRS Implementation: Separate read/write models for optimal performance[7][8]
•Pattern Detection: ML-powered anomaly detection and trend analysis
4. Integration & Connectivity Layer (ICL)
•Multi-Cloud Connectors: Native integrations with AWS, GCP, Azure messaging services
•Legacy System Adapters: Support for traditional messaging systems and protocols
•API Gateway: RESTful and GraphQL APIs for external system integration
•Webhook Management: Reliable webhook delivery with retry mechanisms
5. Governance & Observability Layer (GOL)
•Comprehensive Monitoring: Real-time metrics, tracing, and alerting
•Security Framework: End-to-end encryption, authentication, and authorization
•Audit & Compliance: Full audit trails and regulatory compliance features
•Performance Analytics: AI-driven performance optimization recommendations
