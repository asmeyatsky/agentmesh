Governance & Observability Layer (GOL)
======================================

The Governance & Observability Layer (GOL) provides services for monitoring, securing, and governing the AgentMesh EDA platform.

Core Components
---------------

- **Comprehensive Monitoring:** A system for real-time metrics, tracing, and alerting.
- **Security Framework:** A system for end-to-end encryption, authentication, and authorization.
- **Audit & Compliance:** A system for full audit trails and regulatory compliance features.
- **Performance Analytics:** An AI-driven performance optimization recommendation system.

Usage
-----

To use the GOL, you can use the `PerformanceOptimizer` to get recommendations for improving the performance of your system.

.. code-block:: python

    from agentmesh.gol.performance_optimizer import PerformanceOptimizer

    optimizer = PerformanceOptimizer()
    metrics = {"p99_latency_ms": 300, "error_rate_percent": 10}
    recommendations = optimizer.recommend_optimizations(metrics)
    print(recommendations)
