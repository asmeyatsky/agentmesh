Agent Orchestration Layer (AOL)
================================

The Agent Orchestration Layer (AOL) is responsible for managing the lifecycle of AI agents and coordinating their interactions.

Core Components
---------------

- **Agent Registry:** A service discovery and capability registration system for AI agents.
- **Workflow Engine:** A system that supports various multi-agent system patterns, such as orchestrator-worker, hierarchical, blackboard, and market-based patterns.
- **Dynamic Agent Lifecycle Management:** A system for automatic scaling, health monitoring, and failover of AI agents.
- **Context Management:** A system for distributed state management and agent memory coordination.

Usage
-----

To use the AOL, you first need to create an `AgentCoordinator` instance. Then, you can use the `coordinate_agents` method to execute a multi-agent workflow.

.. code-block:: python

    from agentmesh.aol.coordinator import AgentCoordinator

    coordinator = AgentCoordinator()
    workflow = {
        "requirements": {"capability": "test"},
        "steps": [...]
    }
    result = await coordinator.coordinate_agents(workflow)
