CQRS
====

Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is a pattern that separates read and write operations for a data store. This pattern can improve performance, scalability, and security.

Core Components
---------------

- **Commands:** Objects that represent an intent to change the state of the system.
- **Events:** Objects that represent a change that has already occurred in the system.
- **Command Handlers:** Classes that process commands and generate events.
- **Event Handlers:** Classes that process events and update the read model.
- **Event Store:** A database that stores all the events that have occurred in the system.

Usage
-----

The `agentmesh.cqrs` module provides a simple framework for implementing CQRS. See the example in `agentmesh.cqrs.example` for a demonstration of how to use the framework.
