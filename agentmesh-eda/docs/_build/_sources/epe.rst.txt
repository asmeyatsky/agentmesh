Event Processing Engine (EPE)
==============================

The Event Processing Engine (EPE) is responsible for real-time event correlation, complex event processing, and pattern detection.

Core Components
---------------

- **Stream Processing:** A system for real-time event correlation and complex event processing.
- **Event Sourcing:** A system for providing a complete audit trail with state reconstruction capabilities.
- **CQRS Implementation:** A system that separates read and write models for optimal performance.
- **Pattern Detection:** An ML-powered anomaly detection and trend analysis system.

Usage
-----

To use the EPE, you can use the `AnomalyDetector` to detect anomalies in a stream of data.

.. code-block:: python

    from agentmesh.epe.anomaly_detection import AnomalyDetector

    detector = AnomalyDetector()
    data_stream = [10, 11, 10, 9, 10, 100]
    for data_point in data_stream:
        if detector.detect(data_point):
            print(f"Anomaly detected: {data_point}")
