Multi-Agent System Patterns
===========================

The AgentMesh EDA platform supports several multi-agent system patterns.

Orchestrator-Worker Pattern
---------------------------

In this pattern, an orchestrator agent assigns tasks to worker agents and aggregates the results.

Hierarchical Agent Pattern
--------------------------

In this pattern, agents are organized in a hierarchy, with strategic, tactical, and operational levels.

Blackboard Pattern
------------------

In this pattern, agents communicate and collaborate through a shared knowledge base called a blackboard.

Market-Based Pattern
--------------------

In this pattern, agents compete and cooperate in a marketplace to acquire resources and complete tasks.
